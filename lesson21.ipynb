It does not do a good job of showing how many cases total or why there are spaces that apparently have 0 cases.  Some of the places don't make sense to have little to no cases.  There isnt much explaining in the graph at all actually, but is a nice little depiction of a larger area."

The groups are one solid color and the change for each is not constant (5, 15, 25, 25, 25) The image it self doesn't state whether this is ones, tens, hundres, thousands, millions etc.  This is broad of the sense of numbers and area because its grouped by counties and not down to the individual towns.  The graphic does have a clear purpose of displaying amount of cases, its just not very descriptive."
